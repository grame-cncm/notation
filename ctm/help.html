        <h1>Conference Time Manager</h1>
        <section class=intro>
        <p>
            This tool is designed to facilitate time management at conferences.
            It has already proved to be effective on many occasions. 
            The principle is to automatically generate audible alerts at key points of the time slot, which gives a better perception of the time flow and thus facilitates its management.
        </p>
        <p>The Conference Time Manager has been designed using <a href=https://inscore.grame.fr target=_blank>INScore</a>.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The figure below shows how the time slot is represented with the associated key points. In this case, the time slot goes from 0 to 20 minutes and markers are placed at times 5, 10, 15 and 18 (these are always minutes). As each marker passes, a sound is triggered:
            <li> at 5: a bell</li>
            <li> at 10: two successive bells</li>
            <li> at 15: applause</li>
            <li> at 18: an invitation to the next speaker</li>
        </p>
        <img src=rsrc/screen.png alt="Overview">
        <p>The current time position is represented both in text form (in minutes:seconds, at the top of the page) and as a red dot that moves along the timeline.
            At the bottom of the page, a textual controller allows manage the time flow (start, pause, continue). <br />
            Note that you can also click on the timeline to move to any time position.
        </p>

        <h3>Keyboard control</h3>
        <p>
            You can press keyboard keys to control the time flow:
            <li>'space bar' : start or stop the time flow,</li>
            <li>'0' : move the cursor to the beginning,</li>
            <li>'1' to '4' : moves the cursor to the corresponding marker, tiggers also the corresponding sound.</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Customizing</h2>
        <p>You can customize the duration of the time slot using url parameters:
        <li>'timeslot': changes the time slot duration. Default value is 20 (minutes)</li>
        <li>'questions': changes the time allocated to questions. Default value is a quarter of the time slot.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that a time slot is composed of a 'speak time' followed by a 'questions time' as illustrated by the figure below.
            The sound markers are automatically positionned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the speak period. The questions period starts with applause. The last period is the installation period which starts with an invitation to the next speaker. Its duration is always 2 minutes.
